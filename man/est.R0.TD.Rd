\description{
Estimate the Time-Dependent reproduction number, \eqn{R(t)}, as defined by
Wallinga & Teunis, by exploring all possible pairs of infectors/infectees
across likely transmission trees.
}
\details{
For internal use. Called by \code{\link[=estimate.R]{estimate.R()}}.

The confidence interval is computed by multinomial simulations at each time step,
using the expected value of R.
}
\note{
This is the implementation of the method provided by Wallinga & Teunis (2004).
Correction for estimation in real time is implemented as in Cauchemez et al, AJE (2006).

If imported cases are provided, they are counted in addition to autonomous cases.
The final plot will show overall incidence.
