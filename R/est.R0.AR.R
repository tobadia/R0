#' @description
#' Estimate basic reproduction number R0 from Attack Rate (AR) of an epidemic.
#' 
#' @note
#' This is the implementation of the formula by Dietz (1993).

#' 
#' @details
#' For internal use. Called by [estimate.R()]. 
#' 
#' In the simple SIR model, the relation between R0 and the Attack Rate is in the 
#' form \eqn{R0 = -ln((1-AR)/S0) / (AR - (1-S0))}. If the population size is provided, 
#' the variance of R0 is estimated using the delta method. The hypothesis are that 
#' of homogeneous mixing, no more transmission (epidemic ended), no change in 
#' transmission or interventions during the epidemic. This estimate may be correct 
#' in closed populations, and may be less valid in other cases.
#' 
#' The correction for incomplete susceptibility is based on the SIR model equations.
#' 
#' A 95% confidence interval is computed for the attack rate considering the total
#' population size (\eqn{CI(AR) = AR +/- 1.96*sqrt(AR*(1-AR)/n)}), and so the 
#' confidence interval for the reproduction number is computed with these extreme values.
#' 
#' @param AR Attack rate as a percentage from total population.
#' @param incid Sum of incident cases, possibly in the form of a vector of counts.
#' @param pop.size Population size in which the incident cases were observed.
#' @param S0 Initial proportion of the population considered susceptible.
#' @param checked Internal flag used to check whether integrity checks were ran or not.
#' @param ... Parameters passed to inner functions.
