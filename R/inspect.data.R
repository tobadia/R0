#' Audit input data for common issues
#' 
#' @description
#' Inspect input data and look for common mistakes. 
#' The function does not return any object but yields warnings wupon detecting 
#' possible inconsistencies, along with suggestions as to how to clean inputs 
#' before running estimation routines.
#' 
#' @details
#' [inspect.data()] looks for common issues that could affect estimation routines. 
#' Such issues include too low incidence counts, leading/trailing zeros, 
#' non-integer values...
#' 
#' Before any checks are conducted, the data are passed to [check.incid()] to 
#' try and guess the format of the data.
#' 
#' A not-so-uncommon issue is to provide non-integer counts for incidence, for 
#' example when working with aggregated data that represent averaged number of 
#' cases across different communities. This however does not agree well with 
#' parametric likelihood that assume exponential growth over the early stage of 
#' an epidemic or Poisson distribution of cases, where non-integer values will 
#' cause calculations to fail.
#'
#' Missing values may cause issues if not handled properly. By default, 
#' [check.incid()] will recast missing values to zero. Leading and trailing `NA`'s 
#' should be omitted entirely from the input. Gaps found between available data 
#' may also cause issues if they span over a period that's longer than the total 
#' generation time. A warning is raised to inform on these possible issues.
#' 
#' Likewise, leading and tailing zeros would cause similar issues. Begin will 
#' default to the first value and end to the peak one. Just in case, these will 
#' be inspected here too. Sequence of 0s exceeding the length of the generation 
#' time will also yield a warning.
#' 
#' Scarce data may also cause errors when optimizing likelihood functions. 
#' A time-series of incidence spanning for a duration shorter than that of the 
#' generation time distribution is likely to correspond to an index case that hasn't 
#' yet infected all its offsprings. This would biais estimates downwards and should 
#' be taken into account when interpreting results.
#' 
#' @param incid An object (vector, data.frame, list) storing incidence.
#' @param GT Generation time distribution from [generation.time()]. 
#' @param t Vector of dates at which incidence was observed (optional). 
#' 
#' @return
#' No object is returned. Instead, warnings are thrown upon detecting inconsistences.
